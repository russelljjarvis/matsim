# MATSim

MATSim is a package for simulation of the MAT (Multi-timescale Adaptive Threshold) model [(Kobayashi, 2009)][mat link], i.e., a non-resetting leaky membrane equipped with a dynamic firing threshold.

Two following modes of stimulating conducta are possible:
* Conductances (with reversal potentials) modelled as Poisson shot noise with an exponential envelope
* Conductances (with reversal potentials) modelled as an Ohrstein-Uhlenbeck process
